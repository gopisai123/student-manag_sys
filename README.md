# Student Management System - MERN Project

This project demonstrates how a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application works.  
Itâ€™s used to explore CRUD operations, React components, and backend APIs.

## What It Shows

- Creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (CRUD operations)  
- Simple React components for the user interface  
- Express APIs handling backend requests  
- Using MongoDB to store and manage data

## How to Try It

1. Install the required dependencies.  
2. Start the backend and frontend servers.  
3. Explore the application to see how data flows between frontend and backend.

> Note: This project is a good way to see how a MERN stack application functions and how the parts work together.
